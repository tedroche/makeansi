# makeansi: Snappy ANSI Startup Screens for FoxPro/DOS
![MakeANSI Screen](/images/makeansi.gif)

Create ANSI-screen codes for FoxPro DOS startup screens: fill in that long pause while
FoxPro/DOS starts up and loads its runtime with a colorful animated splash screen.
Build the screen using FPDs @... SAY, @... BOX and other drawing commands, including
color and blink, save the screen to a memory variable and then a MEM file, and then
use MakeANSI.PRG to convert it into a colorful animated splash screen for use during
startup.

* MAKEANSI.MEM: the memory file containing the mScreen screen variable
* MAKEANSI.SCR: the ANSI text file generated by the PRG from the .MEM file
