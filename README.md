# makeansi
Create ANSI-screen codes for FoxPro DOS startup screens: fill in that long pause while
FoxPro/DOS starts up and loads its runtime with a colorful animated splash screen.
Build the screen using FPDs @... SAY, @... BOX and other drawing commands, including
color and blink, save the screen to a memory variable and then a MEM file, and then
use MakeANSI.PRG to convert it into a colorful animated splash screen for use during
startup.
